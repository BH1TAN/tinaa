# TINAA: Tools for Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis

## Summary description
TINAA(Tools for Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis) aims to calculate delayed gamma spectra from basic nuclear databases and sample composition info. 

Several useful tools(functions) could be used independent in nuclear engineering.

The code is writing with MATLAB R2021a. Hope I can push a PYTHON version one day. 

## Introduction


### Database preparation
Using function prepWizard.m to prepare required nuclear databases and sample composition list. 

### Calculate gamma spectra


## Quick start guide
